# Using the UniFi Bridge

In order to use the UniFi Rollup Bridge, you need to have a compatible wallet and some funds on the L1 network.
This guide will help you bridge your funds from the L1 network to the UniFi Rollup network.

## How to bridge (deposit) ETH to UniFi

1. Open the [UniFi Rollup Bridge UI](https://testnet-bridge-unifi.puffer.fi/).
2. Connect your preffered wallet.

3. Switch your connected network to L1 (Holesky).

   - This can be done manually from the top right corner of the page by clicking on your wallet address.

4. Select the token and the amount you want to bridge and press continue.

   When bridging ERC20 tokens, you will have an additional transaction to approve the bridge contract to spend your tokens.

1. Press the Claim button on the transaction.
